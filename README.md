# Svelte Scan QR

## Description

This is a simple SvelteKit project where you can generate and download a QR code based on any text you want - __including [LINKS](https://drakeafk.io)__!
Over time, I may improve this project to include more features - _batch creation_, _QR code scanning_, _QR code generation based on images_, _QR code generation based on spreadsheets_, who knows what else!

Feel free to contribute to this project if you want to add any features or fix any bugs!
